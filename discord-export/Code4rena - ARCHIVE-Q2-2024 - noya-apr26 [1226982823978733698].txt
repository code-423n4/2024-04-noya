is it possible to rework the [out-of-scope](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-noya?tab=readme-ov-file#files-out-of-scope) part by grouping the files by folders instead of listing all of them?

How do you know that this is from CodeHawks?


[04/27/2024 06:46] uaarrr
it was a joke, codehawks had a past contest few months ago where mocks where in scope  & in the end  vulns in mock files were awarded until everyone start talking and they modified the results with only the ``important`` vulnerabilities , this contest is not linked in any way with that

After executing the "forge test" command, a large number of errors are reported，who can tell me why？


[04/29/2024 09:10] moeid3
you should insert your RPCs in .env file . although i did that and got less errors not 0


[04/29/2024 09:11] by_dlife
Let me try it


[04/29/2024 09:12] hadiesna
Hmmm
I think because RPCs are set in "testFoundry/utils/resources/*" files
Please update the RPC endpoints there to fix the issue
In each file there is a "RPC_URL" variable that you can change
Tests are not using ".env"

I guess it's total amount of base token that has been withdrawn... It's doc is missing in contract


[04/30/2024 13:16] brivan
Check the comments on the interface `IAccountingMangaer`


[04/30/2024 13:16] mylifechangefast.eth_70767
Would there be anyway users can withdraw to reduce the Tvl?


[04/30/2024 13:58] hadiesna
It's just depositing the LP position into stargate staking contract
Can you ask the question more clearly?


[04/30/2024 13:59] hadiesna
It's being added as a connector to the registry


[04/30/2024 14:00] hadiesna
So the flow is:
- Add trusted tokens to the registry
- Add trusted position of those tokes
- Create the position in the connector (and it'll be added to the registry, as a holding position)


[04/30/2024 14:01] hadiesna
yes they can withdraw and reduce the TVL


[04/30/2024 14:01] hadiesna
But when they withdraw, the price of each share in terms of base tokens will be the same


[04/30/2024 14:03] mylifechangefast.eth_70767
The Tvl will not reduce?


[04/30/2024 14:05] hadiesna

@hadi esna hello, in a Connector **who** will call function to enter the protocol (**E.g. ** the supply function in AaveConnector) ? and at what frequency it will be called ?


[05/02/2024 16:48] hadiesna
@here Hey everyone 
It's been a really great week so far talking to all of you about Noya
You guys are truly amazing and we appreciate your effort 
I wanted to give a feedback that I think will help both of us. I noticed in the past couple of days that there aren’t many activity around "connectors" folder. I understand that you need to understand other sections to get there but I just wanted to emphasis that this section due to its nature (connecting with other protocols and more moving parts) is more likely to have issues.
So you'll probably find less duplicate stuff if you search more evenly  💓

@hadi esna Could you please check my private thread when you have time?


[05/03/2024 17:52] cholakovv
from my understanding the keepers interact with the connector contracts and the normal users can't.
for example in the withdraw flow, after starting a withdraw group the keeper interacts with the connectors to burn positions and swap tokens to the base token

When `executeDeposit` is called, funds (base token) are moved from `accountingManager` to a connector contract via the connector's `addLiquidity` function. For the opposite direction, when the `accountingManager` needs funds for withdrawal requests, it has the function `retrieveTokensForWithdraw` to retrieve the base token from the connectors. Note that the connectors should already hold the funds. There is another flow for depositing and retrieving funds between connectors and external protocols (i.e. positions). This is how I understand the mechanics.

Hi @hadi esna 

As for `execute `function in `keepers `contract 

1. is the executor expected  to feed the signatures  in ascending order of their corresponsing address values ? 

2. What is the purpose of the `executor ` parameter (which can be set by the caller) , when there is already the` isOwner[msg.sender] ` check?

IERC20(data.pool).balanceOf(address(this))  could someone explain how to understand it? I mean it -> IERC20(data.pool)?

Why pool needs to inherit the IERC20 interface?


[05/06/2024 17:43] benrai
The shares it the pool should be ERC20 tokens, right? 🤔


[05/06/2024 17:45] 0xauditism
I don't think we need to attach the interface to it, but it is more understandable this way


[05/06/2024 17:46] evokid
data.pool should equal an address
`struct WithdrawData {
    address pool;
    uint256 amountLiquidity;
    uint256 min0Min;
    uint256 min1Min;
    uint2`56 deadline;

yes they are the same entity


[05/08/2024 11:13] hadiesna
Sure on it


[05/08/2024 11:18] hadiesna
So I'll explain the idea with an example:
In uniswap connector, the goal is to deposit tokens into the uniswap pool and hold the position NFT
For doing so, we need to add its corresponding "trustedPositionBP" to the registery so the registry acknowledges this position as a valid position in this vault
Then later when we actually create that position, the connector contract creates a Holding position in the registry which represents the position NFT

To explain in simple words:
trustedPositionBP are the potential positions and Holding positions are the positions that we actually have at the moment

{Reactions}
👍 (5) 

[05/08/2024 11:30] hadiesna
There are some positions, that can be transferred to other connectors (or other connectors can create them) like position of holding a token.
by setting "onlyOwner" bool we can set that other connectors can create this position or not
"isDebt" indicates that we have to deduct the value of this position from the total value of the vault (it's not a credit positon)
We don't have any of these positions at the moment but we might have later

@hadi esna what are the functions to be called to transfer funds from a protocol to another protocol in another chain ?


[05/08/2024 19:32] hadiesna
So in other chains connectors will be deployed and we can use "transferPositionToAnotherConnector" function to do this


[05/08/2024 19:33] hadiesna
for each position type it should be the number that is used when the position is being created (like UNI_LP_POSITION_TYPE in uniswapV3 connector)

to send tokens from a connector to another connector in another chain they need to be bridged, but  "transferPositionToAnotherConnector" does not bridge the tokens .

[05/09/2024 14:36] hadiesna

[05/09/2024 14:38] hadiesna
yes
They can be bridged by adding "OmnichainManagerBaseChain.sol" and "OmnichainManagerNormalChain.sol" to these chains as connectors


[05/09/2024 14:39] hadiesna
and then these contracts can take care of the bridging


[05/09/2024 14:41] noro9954
what functions in "OmnichainManagerBaseChain" that are responsible for that ?


[05/09/2024 14:48] hadiesna
It inherits from "OmnichainLogic" and you can check "startBridgeTransaction" function there


[05/09/2024 15:12] noro9954
from what i can see its using lifi to bridge tokens, not LayerZero, is that correct ?


[05/09/2024 15:15] hadiesna

Layer zero is just for passing information (sending messages) not for bridging

@hadi esna from the docs of value oracle : 
> we have a price source for tokens A-B, B-C, C-D and we want to get the price of A-D. we can define the route of [B,C] in the smart contract and it loops through the route to get the price of A-D.
the example here is not very clear, what is meant by a route ?


[05/11/2024 16:58] ivi4yh3ivi
i understood that to mean that a token pair is a route. 

 `[B,C]` is a token pair/price source that can represent something like a `[ETH/BTC]` pair. that can be used as a route to figure out whatever the price is of the  `[A,D]` pair.

Hi 👋 Which version of the Lz is used in the protocol?


[05/15/2024 17:44] 0xabhay.
V2


[05/15/2024 18:56] wanziskata
If `calculatePositionId`, from the Registry contract, is used to create a unique id for a position, would it necessarily mean that the created id is for a holding position?

Hello @hadi esna  or anyone well acquainted with the protocol
- will different different vaults share same connectors?

The question is weird but like 
2 vaults on polygon chain use same aave connector on the chain

No. team is confirming/disputing now. Judge labels with satisfactory / unsatisfactory. By judging I meant judging by the judge.

Could someone please help me figure out whether you should be able to see the findings you submitted and that were confirmed by the judges somewhere on the dashboard or receive an email about that? Or you are not supposed to know which of your findings were confirmed until the whole judging period ends and rewards are announced?

if you don't have the SR role, you will see what is accepted when the audit report is out, if customer opts for it to be released.

First of all, I have to thank Code4rena judges for taking the trouble and doing the hard work of judging 🥇❤️‍🔥   , I think that what the platforms should consider is that in the future the judging  process should take much less time (for example, one to two weeks) because definitely in the future, competitions and demand will increase, so the speed of our actions must increase. Thank you to Code4rena and its judges :10_10: 🙏

Hey all, appreciate your patience. As always we endeavour to send awards ASAP, and are just waiting for the sponsor team to confirm that they have no further questions for the judge before we finalize results. This was a busy audit with many submissions, so we don't want to rush them.

Hi @CloudEllie - away ‘til 19 Aug, respectfully, it seams to me that not much has happened in the judging process for the last 10 days. 
I think me and some other participants are wondering if it is normal that it takes 10 days + for a sponsor to give a feedback if they still have questions or not.  Would be great to get an official statement of the state of the judging and if we should be expecting the results to take 2 more weeks or if the target time for finalization is more like a couple of day away. Thanks in advance for your feedback 🙂

They should pay compensation ngl.. For keeping us waiting🥺🥺

Or is it the reward noya promised us that's keeping this longer?


[06/29/2024 20:44] benrai
There is nothing written in the rules that states the the judging and reward distribution needs to be done within a specific time frame. Or am I mistaking? 🤔 So I would say compensation for waiting is not appropriate 😉 But a little bit more communication about expected time frames would not be the worst thing to improve the way people perceive the judging process  of C4 I guess 🤷🏻‍♂️

@CloudEllie - away ‘til 19 Aug hello, I am completely unknown from what is happening in backstage as I don't have required role, from above discussions I understood that the process could be faster than this and result would have been announced, I don't have any problem if it going to take more time if lead judge has to complete escalations but if not please give us some information about the backstage condition. Thanks in advance for your feedback.

[07/01/2024 08:23] cloudellie
Very sorry for the delays, everyone. The combination of a very high volume of submissions, busier-than-average post-judging QA, and the diligence that these two things require from the judge and sponsor team, has stretched the timeline beyond what's typical for Code4rena. 

We always endeavour to post awards as quickly as possible, but our north star is always securing projects, which means that we hold very high standards for both supporting sponsors through the review phase, and thorough and accurate judging. Sometimes -- as is the case here -- that results in delays.

Staff are doing their best to obtain final decisions so we can announce awards ASAP. If we don't post daily updates, it's because we don't like stringing people along or making promises that we can't guarantee. Really appreciate everyone's patience. 🙏

@CloudEllie - away ‘til 19 Aug is doing a lot of work and amazing job constantly in C4, it's not really easy, C4 staff trying to do their best. I can't complain. I can just wait and be thankful that there is amazing people like this to treat and take care of process with no stop with all those contests that coming one after another. Please Wardens be patient be supportive. Please remember that all those efforts always takes time, there is no short cuts or a magic stick to speed up the process. What else we should say? Nothing except I would like to thank this platform and the staff for this amazing work, it doesn't matter how much time it takes. It matters that we support their efforts as good community and spread the good vibe to help them more than complaining. This is my personal opinion, you can like it or disagree, I wish everyone the best. 🎉

I think for this contest it was understanding the overall concept of the connectors and grinding through all the connectors. And make sure to also understand how the external protocol works. Also I only focused on the connectors and did not have time to take a look at the other parts of the protocol.
